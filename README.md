<h2>The Game of your live</h2>

<img src="hangman-game.jpg" alt="hangman game"/> 

<p>This is a simple <strong>Hangman game</strong> built with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, where the main theme revolves around <strong>sports names</strong>. The game is designed to help users guess the names of different sports in <strong>English</strong>.</p>

<h2>🎯 Game Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to guess the hidden sport name by selecting one letter at a time. Each wrong guess will bring the player closer to losing, as the hangman figure starts to appear. If the player makes too many wrong guesses, the game is over!</p>

<h2>🏆 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Built with <strong>React</strong> for a fast and responsive interface.</li>
  <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> provides type safety and scalability.</li>
  <li>Sports-themed word list in <strong>English</strong>.</li>
  <li>Dynamic UI that updates with every correct or incorrect guess.</li>
  <li>Fun and interactive for players of all ages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 How to Play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The game displays empty spaces representing the letters of a hidden sport's name.</li>
  <li>Players select letters they think are in the sport's name.</li>
  <li>For every correct guess, the corresponding letter will appear in the word.</li>
  <li>For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.</li>
  <li>The game ends when either the word is fully guessed, or the hangman is completely drawn.</li>
</ol>

<h2>👨‍💻 Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>React</strong> for building the user interface.</li>
  <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> for type safety and better code structure.</li>
  <li>CSS for styling.</li>
</ul>
